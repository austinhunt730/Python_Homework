The Random Forest model achieved about 57% accuracy, showing it can distinguish between regular and premium customers only slightly better than chance. Performance was much stronger for regular customers, while predictions for premium customers were weak, largely because the model leaned heavily on total spending as the main feature, with purchase count and device type contributing very little. This imbalance suggests that the current features are insufficient to capture what makes a customer premium, and improvements will likely require balancing the dataset and adding richer behavioral or engagement features to strengthen predictive power.
